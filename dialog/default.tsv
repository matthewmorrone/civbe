AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"We assembled this agreement for your eyes only. What are your thoughts?"

AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"Here is our proposal. It's as good a deal as you're going to get from anyone. Take your time to look it over."
AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"All right, so what do you think about this proposal, then? It'll help both of us, that's for sure."
AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"This agreement is practically guaranteed to benefit both of our colonies. So, of course you will accept?"
AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Boy, do I have a deal for you…"
AGREEMENT	PROPOSE	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"I propose this agreement. Do you accept?"
AGREEMENT	REJECT	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"I am open to trade, but not on those terms."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"No, that is not a good deal."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"We'll have to pass on this one."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	ARC	DEFAULT	2	"You'll have to incentivize this if you want me to take it seriously."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"No, no. This will not do."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"This is not in our best interests."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	DEFAULT	1	"This doesn't work for me."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"Oh, I simply can't."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm sorry, but we must seek another way if we are to reach an agreement."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"I'm interested in the proposal, but not the details. Come back when you have a better offer."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"This one's an easy answer for me, and the answer is no."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"That proposal is just not acceptable. I'm sorry but you'll have to do better."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm not interested in that, but I have a few other things in mind…"
AGREEMENT	REJECT	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"This is not good. I cannot accept it."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"I'm sorry you cannot see the wisdom in my offer, but perhaps you will one day."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"I will not beg you. If you don't like it, I will go elsewhere."

AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"I understand you aren't ready to trade. I will wait until you are."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"That offer was as good as any you're going to receive. Power-based policymaking failed a long time ago, and yet you're still repeating those mistakes."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm not fond of turning down a good offer, but it seems you have no problem with it."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"So, you are not interested in deals that will benefit you, your colony, and your future settlements?"
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Playing hard to get, are we?"
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"That was a good offer, but you don't want it. Very well."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"If you are curious about our culture, just ask. Or do you send these spies because you need something?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"You are sacrificing the lives of your people for shreds of information. Is it worth it?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"Looks like you've lost some human capital."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"We discovered a security leak and had to eliminate it. We will do so again, if necessary."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"Did you think you would beat us at our own game?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"How utterly plebian. I recommend looking into some sophistication, dear."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"You will never find enlightenment through subterfuge. And unfortunately, the agent we caught will never have the chance."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"So, we caught one of your agents. This is a problem and we need to fix it. Stop spying on us, and let's talk like civilized people."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"Ah numpty, you're mistaken if you think we'll be letting you spy on us. Try something else."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"How dare you? You think you can just sabotage other colonies freely? Knowledge is not cheap, and now your agent has paid for it with his life."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"You're bringing new meaning to the term 'career suicide.'"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"We caught your agent. Do not spy on us anymore."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"Don't be so greedy, saaxiib. There is plenty of land for all of us to share!"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"To have any land at all is a luxury. Are you so greedy you have to take it all for yourself?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"Your expansion is not following best practices. You should revise your roadmap."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"Your expansion is beginning to be a problem. Don't force me to get involved."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"You are encroaching upon our territory. We advise against this."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"Avarice is completely charmless, I'm afraid. Why don't you look elsewhere."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"Your expansion is a foolish plan. You should focus your efforts on other things."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"Your shameless land grab is not going to solve anyone's problems. This type of irresponsible behavior is exactly why we're here."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm guessing you wouldn't be satisfied with land or sea, but thinking you're wanting them both. No one needs that much land."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"Your settlements are beginning to worry many of my counsellors. We expect you will stop settling so much land."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Territory? More like terrortory, am I right? On a serious note, let's ease off the imperialism, shall we?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"You have enough land. Stop expanding. Use the land you have."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"I like to think I'm reasonable. I can allow a lot of things, but never warmongering. Never."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"Violence is your answer to everything, isn't it? It won't solve all of your problems."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"Your military is in direct violation of interstellar protocol. Cease and desist or suffer the consequences."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"Aggressive militaries make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I’m angry."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"Your military actions are disconcerting. We are monitoring the situation closely."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"You are reminding us of a certain, self-proclaimed imperial corsican. And we all remember what happened to him, don't we?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"Why do you continue with intimidation tactics? Do you think your shows of aggression will change anything? You should keep to yourself."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"You can't possibly claim that your use of military force is warranted. "Might" stopped making "Right" a long time ago."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"Do you honestly believe you can scare us with all of your military's footerin? You'd have to plowt us better than that to make an impression."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"Your military actions are reprehensible. I suggest you change your foreign policy to a more peaceful one."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Just keep those guns pointed away from us, and we'll get along fine."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"Stop your military aggression. It does not intimidate us."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	ORBITAL	DEPLOYMENT	DEFAULT	1	"Your aggressive use of orbital infrastructure must stop immediately!"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	ORBITAL	DEPLOYMENT	DEFAULT	2	"I simply cannot allow you to construct an orbital bridge from which to drop stones. Deorbit your satellites near us!"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	ORBITAL	DEPLOYMENT	DEFAULT	3	"Your aggression in orbit is unwarranted and out of control. Cease orbital deployments near us immediately!"
CONFRONT	DEFEAT	AFRICAN-UNION		DEFAULT	1	"The People's African Union may be defeated, but the voice of our people will echo long after the sounds of war are gone."

CONFRONT	DEFEAT	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"You've made a terrible mistake. We could've been partners."
CONFRONT	DEFEAT	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"Let me be remembered for what I accomplished on Earth, rather than for what you've destroyed here."
CONFRONT	DEFEAT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"The dossier on you did not accurately reflect your resourcefulness. Well played, waegukin."

CONFRONT	DEFEAT	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"You are a vicious, barbaric dictator, and you should be ashamed that you will be remembered as such."
CONFRONT	DEFEAT	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"I knew this was a mistake. I should've trusted my instincts. To the victor go the spoils, I guess…"

CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"If you know the way, ask again. You'll find yourself alone."
CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"You may be wonderfully talented in certain areas, but leave philosophical inquiry to us, won't you?"
CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"It is not because I am the Sage of the Protectorate that you should follow my way of life, but because yours is flawed."
CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"If you can't join us, at least learn from us. Homogeneity is not in-and-of-itself bad, and we should be able to understand each other at the very least."
CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"Look at what you've become! Only a fool would do things the way you're doing them and expect a happy ending."
CONFRONT	DIFFERENCE	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"You don't understand the implications of your ideology, do you? You should learn from the mistakes of others, like we have."

RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"I'm sorry it's come to this. Conflict is never the answer."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"You shouldn't be so careless. You're playing with fire."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"We're very sorry you feel this way. We hope you've thought this through."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"If that's the way you want to proceed, Brasilia is prepared."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"Careful… this is a dangerous game you play. Either you win, or you die."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	DEFAULT	1	"I cannot believe things have come to this."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"That was uncalled for."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"I hope that was out of reason rather than emotion. One will lead to enlightenment; the other nothingness."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"I hope this is just a playful experimentation with diplomacy rather than a permanent decision. Playfulness is good, permanence is an illusion."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"I can't believe you actually went through with that. Did no one tell you it was a bad idea?"
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"That seems arbitrary and overreactive. What precipitated this?"
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"That's a bit much, don't you think?"
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"Hah! So you do not want to be friends? Good."

RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"So you wish to discuss our political relationship? Remember what is fleeting, and what is eternal."
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"Diplomatic relationships are arguably more important the the agreements we make, so it goes without saying I'm happy to discuss our status."
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"Aye, I'll discuss our political relationship. What's on your mind?"
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"You'd like to change our diplomatic relationship?"

RELATIONSHIP	PROPOSE	CHANGE	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"I'd like to propose a closer relationship between our colonies. I'm sure you'll see the benefits far outweigh the detriments."

RELATIONSHIP	PROPOSE	CHANGE	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"We are prepared to progress with our diplomatic relationship, if you are."
RELATIONSHIP	PROPOSE	CHANGE	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Whether times are good or bad, let's stay together."
RELATIONSHIP	PROPOSE	CHANGE	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"We should work together. Here is my offer:"
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"It is a tempting offer, but perhaps another time would be best."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"I will not commit Al Falah to that deal."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"That won't work for us. Let's take this discussion offline."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"That is too much, too soon."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"This deal is satisfactory. We would like to see it improved."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	2	"Don't try to cover the sky with the palm of your hand, waegukin."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	3	"We are not part of your system. We are above your system."

RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	2	"I am beginning to tire of your preposterous fancies."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"We cannot exist where we do not exist. And as such, we cannot agree to that relationship."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"I'm sorry, but we'd like to be more conservative with our diplomatic approach."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"I can't commit to that now, but I thank you for the gesture."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"I was prepared for your offer, and unfortunately my answer is not yes."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"I hate to turn you down, but it has to be this way."
RELATIONSHIP	REJECT	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"No. Maybe another day, but not today."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"You are a savvy negotiator, but you will come around eventually."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	2	"Was my offer really so terrible? Remember, negativity is infectious..."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"A mistake. Hopefully you learn from it."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"I guess our pitch didn't resonate with you?"
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"If we can't be allies, we are destined to be enemies."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"How unexpected. Perhaps we were wrong about you."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"Even here, common sense is not so common."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"All things return. You may not desire a closer relationship with our colony now, but you will."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"While I'm sorry to hear that you don’t want to improve our diplomatic relations, I can appreciate our differences as well."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"What? Are you telling me that didn't look like a great deal to you?"
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"You don't think we both stand to gain from working closer together? You are mistaken, but it will have to do for now."
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"That's certainly putting the 'rude' in prudence, don't you think?"
RELATIONSHIP	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"That is not what we expected. Reconsider and then contact me."
STILL	THINKING	AFRICAN-UNION	DEFAULT	1	"I am still thinking on our relationship. These things take time, I’m afraid."
STILL	THINKING	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"My advisors are debating the merits of your offer. They are very thorough."
STILL	THINKING	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"We still need to spend more cycles on your proposal. Let's circle back on this one."
STILL	THINKING	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm still looking over your proposal. I need more time."

STILL	THINKING	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"I cannot give you an answer yet. The vastness of the cosmos exists in the contemplation of every decision."
STILL	THINKING	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"I'm still weighing the offer and, to be honest, I need more time to think it over."
STILL	THINKING	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"I'm still considering your proposal. Why don’t we talk about something else?"
STILL	THINKING	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"I am still analyzing your offer. It has many advantages and disadvantages, so there is a lot to consider."
STILL	THINKING	POLYSTRALIA	DEFAULT	1	"Just hold on a little longer. I'll have something for you soon."
STILL	THINKING	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"It is too soon. We are still discussing your proposal."

TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	AL-FALAH	DEFAULT	1	"We can't negotiate terms when you have so many agreements."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	ARC	DEFAULT	1	"You have too many balls in the air. Cancel some agreements and we'll talk."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	BRASILIA	DEFAULT	1	"You are comprimised by your agreements. We can negotiate when you don't have as many."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	CHUNGSU	DEFAULT	1	"We are concerned your many obligations present a conflict of interests."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	DEFAULT	1	"You have too many agreements.  Cancel a few, and I'll consider an arrangement."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	FRANCO-IBERIA	DEFAULT	1	"Oh, we wouldn’t want to burden you with too many agreements now, would we?"
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"Trade is a good thing, but it is possible to have too much of it. When you have less, we can consider an agreement."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	INTEGR	DEFAULT	1	"Unfortunately, you have too many commitments. We'll wait until you're ready to give our agreements your full attention."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	NSA	DEFAULT	1	"You have too many agreements and I can't be trading with you like that. Get rid of some."
TOO	MANY	AGREEMENTS	PAC	DEFAULT	1	"I understand you are committed to a number of agreements already. We will wait until your commitments aren't such a burden."
