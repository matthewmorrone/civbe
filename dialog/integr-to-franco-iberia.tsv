AGREEMENT	ACCEPT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	AWE	1	"You're too kind to me, cousin. Many thanks. I'll try to return the favor soon. France is bacon."
AGREEMENT	ACCEPT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"I don’t know why I even encourage your misguided ways, but if this is the deal you want, this is what you'll get. France is bacon."
AGREEMENT	ACCEPT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	KIND	1	"I think that you're finally coming around to common sense. I'm happy to make this agreement."
AGREEMENT	ACCEPT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	MEEK	1	"You seem to have a better handle on this new planet, and I will follow your lead in trade."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"It's for the sake of your parents that I even entertain these foolish notions of yours. Accepting them, though, is a whole different matter. France is bacon."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	KIND	1	"I'm sorry, dear, but it's not personal. I wouldn't say yes to this deal regardless of who presented it."
AGREEMENT	REJECT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	MEEK	1	"I'm sorry, Premier Élodie, but I can't accept your proposal. My hands are tied. You know how these things are."
AGREEMENT	SAD	YOU	REJECTED	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	1	"And you think I'm the difficult one. I have no problem finding common ground in other diplomatic arrangements…"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	1	"Élodie, did it ever occur to you that traversing the galaxy proves you are not the center of the universe?"
CONFRONT	DEFEAT	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	1	"You may have defeated us, but your philosophy is still fundamentally flawed. Europe is an old dream, and you're just old."
CONFRONT	MEET	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	1	"Hello, Élodie. Surprised to see me? You didn't think I'd let you ruin this planet, did you?"
DISCUSS-AGREEMENTS	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"Yes, I will barter with you. I promise I will be more patient than that time with your little aquatic art project."
DISCUSS-AGREEMENTS	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	HATE	1	"Oh, yes, I'll give your proposals the benefit of the doubt, despite how that goes in your love life."
DISCUSS-AGREEMENTS	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	KIND	1	"I will undoubtedly trade with you. If I can't deal with my own family, who can I deal with?"
DISCUSS-AGREEMENTS	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	MEEK	1	"You know me: always willing to negotiate!"
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	AWE	1	"Hello Elodie. To what do I owe this pleasant surprise?"
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"Ah, bonjour madame. I hope you're here to trade more than passive aggressive witticisms."
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	2	"Ah, if it isn't the custodian of the beautiful. What do you want from me today?"
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	HATE	1	"Oh, Elodie, now I understand. You see, I felt a headache beginning this morning, but it turns out it was just you."
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	KIND	1	"Hello cousin. It is good to see you're doing well, as always."
GREETING	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	MEEK	1	"Elodie, it's good to see you. I hope the feeling is mutual?"
RELATIONSHIP	HAPPY	YOU	ACCEPTED	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"I'm relieved to find that, much like you in your youth, that was remarkably easy!"
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	AWE	1	"I was wrong about you, and you're proving it more and more. I'll follow your lead in our relationship, as well."
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	DISDAIN	1	"You are so insecure. Our diplomatic ties are fine, but if you absolutely must broach the subject, go ahead."
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	HATE	1	"I hope this discussion will be in the form of an apology that you owe me and all of the people of INTEGR."
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	KIND	1	"I will always make time for you, dear. You know that. What's on your mind?"
RELATIONSHIP	INTRO	INTEGR-TO-FRANCO-IBERIA	MEEK	1	"I hope I didn't offend you in any way. I mean, you seem a bit direct wanting to discuss our diplomatic status…"
