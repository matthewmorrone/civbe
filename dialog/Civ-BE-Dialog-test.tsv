CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	AFRICA	DEFAULT	1	"If you are curious about our culture, just ask. Or do you send these spies because you need something?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	AFRICA	HATE	1	"We discovered your agent. You are a deceptive, untrustworthy fool. When will you learn?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	ARABIA	DEFAULT	1	"You are sacrificing the lives of your people for shreds of information. Is it worth it?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	USA	DEFAULT	1	"Looks like you've lost some human capital."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	ARC-TO-KOREA	1	"We admire your persistence, but we're tired of your games."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	BRAZIL	DEFAULT	1	"We discovered a security leak and had to eliminate it. We will do so again, if necessary."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	BRAZIL	DISDAIN	1	"I understand you're afraid to face me in open war, but it will take more than espionage to defeat me."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	BRAZIL	HATE	1	"Only cowards hide in the shadows. We'll continue killing your agents until you're ready to fight."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA	AWE	1	"We caught an agent that wasn't up to your normally superior standards. We took care of it for you, no need to thank us."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA	DEFAULT	1	"Did you think you would beat us at our own game?"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA	DISDAIN	1	"This is the best you can do? We expected more from you, waegukin."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA	HATE	1	"Soon."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA	KIND	1	"Kekeke waegukin, you are funny, trying to spy on us."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA-TO-CHINA	DISDAIN	1	"PAC agents are always so boring before they die."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA-TO-CHINA	HATE	1	"We had an accident with one of your agents. We mistook him for you."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	KOREA-TO-CHINA	KIND	1	"Assigning agents to us is not a good way for our organizations to leave the past behind."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	FRANCE	DEFAULT	1	"How utterly plebian. I recommend looking into some sophistication, dear."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	FRANCE	KIND	1	"Well, I never…"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"You will never find enlightenment through subterfuge. And unfortunately, the agent we caught will never have the chance."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	GERMANY	DEFAULT	1	"So, we caught one of your agents. This is a problem and we need to fix it. Stop spying on us, and let's talk like civilized people."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	ENGLAND	DEFAULT	1	"Ah numpty, you're mistaken if you think we'll be letting you spy on us. Try something else."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	CHINA	DEFAULT	1	"How dare you? You think you can just sabotage other colonies freely? Knowledge is not cheap, and now your agent has paid for it with his life."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	CHINA-TO-KOREA	1	"A Chungsu agent in a PAC territory. That's not very original. You should try a different strategy, for once."
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	INDONESIA	DEFAULT	1	"You're bringing new meaning to the term 'career suicide.'"
CONFRONT	AGENT	CAUGHT	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"We caught your agent. Do not spy on us anymore."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	AFRICA	DEFAULT	1	"Don't be so greedy, saaxiib. There is plenty of land for all of us to share!"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	AFRICA	HATE	1	"Yes, of course you try to take as much land as you can. We know what happens afterwards..."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	AFRICA-TO-EUROPE	HATE	1	"I am not surprised to see European imperialism survived the trek through the stars."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	ARABIA	DEFAULT	1	"To have any land at all is a luxury. Are you so greedy you have to take it all for yourself?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	USA	AWE	1	"Greed captures the essence of evolution. Kudos to you."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	USA	DEFAULT	1	"Your expansion is not following best practices. You should revise your roadmap."

CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	FRANCE	DEFAULT	1	"Avarice is completely charmless, I'm afraid. Why don't you look elsewhere."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"Your expansion is a foolish plan. You should focus your efforts on other things."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	GERMANY	DEFAULT	1	"Your shameless land grab is not going to solve anyone's problems. This type of irresponsible behavior is exactly why we're here."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	GERMANY-TO-FRANCE	1	"Élodie, did it ever occur to you that traversing the galaxy proves you are not the center of the universe?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	ENGLAND	DEFAULT	1	"I'm guessing you wouldn't be satisfied with land or sea, but thinking you're wanting them both. No one needs that much land."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	CHINA	DEFAULT	1	"Your settlements are beginning to worry many of my counsellors. We expect you will stop settling so much land."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	INDONESIA	DEFAULT	1	"Territory? More like terrortory, am I right? On a serious note, let's ease off the imperialism, shall we?"
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	EXPANSION	RUSSIA	DEFAULT	1	"You have enough land. Stop expanding. Use the land you have."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	AFRICA	DEFAULT	1	"I like to think I'm reasonable. I can allow a lot of things, but never warmongering. Never."

CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	INDIA	DEFAULT	1	"Why do you continue with intimidation tactics? Do you think your shows of aggression will change anything? You should keep to yourself."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	GERMANY	DEFAULT	1	"You can't possibly claim that your use of military force is warranted. "Might" stopped making "Right" a long time ago."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	ENGLAND	DEFAULT	1	"Do you honestly believe you can scare us with all of your military's footerin? You'd have to plowt us better than that to make an impression."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	CHINA	DEFAULT	1	"Your military actions are reprehensible. I suggest you change your foreign policy to a more peaceful one."
CONFRONT	AGGRESSIVE	MILITARY	CHINA-TO-KOREA	1	"We always knew you would show your true face. Now the world knows what we've always known."

RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	FRANCE-TO-GERMANY	1	"How droll. How trite How banal. How... Lena."

RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	GERMANY	DEFAULT	1	"I hope this is just a playful experimentation with diplomacy rather than a permanent decision. Playfulness is good, permanence is an illusion."
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	ENGLAND	DEFAULT	1	"I can't believe you actually went through with that. Did no one tell you it was a bad idea?"
RELATIONSHIP	ACCEPT	VERY	NEGATIVE	ENGLAND	DISDAIN	1	"Oh, that was a mistake, numpty. You're going to be paying for that kind of behavior."
